# Coding rules

![](https://img.shields.io/github/check-runs/black-desk/coding-rules/master)

This is a documentation repository recording the coding rules that I
studied and thinking that I should follow in my personal projects.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
